- To refactor a set of modules out of the current monolithic Readium structure into major components.
    - Readium library
    - Readium viewer
    - epub api
    - epub rendering 
    - separate modules for each type of epub (reflowing, scrolling, fixed)
    - parsing
    - extraction
    - persistence
- To reduce dependencies between the various "components" of Readium and create clear, documented, APIs. 
- To enable a more adaptable structure for requesting and rendering epub resources. Want to be able to pre-load resources from 
  the epub and display them, when required. Want to be able to configure the pre-loading strategy. Want to be able to mix fixed and 
  reflowable epubs on the same page
- Want to be able to easily deploy fully client-side, or on server and client. 
- Want to be able to integrate into major web frameworks easily.
